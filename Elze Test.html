      <h2 class="heading-font"> Pleasers as Entry To My Alter Ego </h2>
      <h3 class="heading-font"> Introduction </h3>
  
  
      <p>
        For starters, I’d like to begin with an anecdote from my life that I’m personally fond of. When I was around 4/5 years old I was attending a kinder garden in Kaunas, Lithuania. To set the scene it was a basic kinder garden with a soviet leftover playground, ugly and rusty. One day, I’m not sure due to what occasion but my father recalls and event where all the kids answered the question of ‘What do you want to be when you grow up?’ all the answers from the other children where quite typical, fireman, policewomen, singer ect. However, when it came to my turn my parents recount an answer they'll never forget. What was my response? Well it was simple, 
        <h2 class="heading-font"> ‘I want to be a beautiful girl’...  </h2>
        <P> Now around 20 years later I embody the fantasy of being a ‘beautiful girl’ through my alter ego. The definition of an alter ego revolves around ‘Means (of) an alternate self, which is believed to be distinct from a person's normal or true original personality. Finding one's alter ego will require finding one's other self, one with a different personality.’ For me personally the idea of an alter ego (from a design perspective) functions as a tool to explore everything related to design and curation. The inspiration behind my alter ego is myself, but an enhanced and highly curated version of me, in terms of fashion, styling, attitude and self expression. I view it as a direct embodiment of elements of my life i choose to include and choose to keep. I’m designing my own narrative around a character (physical or digital 3D) based off my influences, dreams, desires, fantasies and the powerful women I admire. If i would have to put it simply, her names Zarissa (this started off as a complete joke a while ago), she is strong and sexy, stripping, rich, smart and decked out in designer, and of course owns hundreds of Pleasers. But more from her later. </P>
        <H3 class="heading-font" >  What are Pleasers? </H3>
 <P> ‘Pleasers’ is the name of the brand that make shoes for stippers and in tern pole dancers, they are heels ranging from 6-11 inches (15,24cm to 27,94) highly engineered for body movement. Similar to ballet many moves within stipping and pole dance are performed on point, therefore Pleasers have a smooth curve at the front allowing a stable movement from a flat platform to point, this is practical for making prettier shapes with the body and making the feet look pointed. Another element is the way that Pleasers elongate the body, making the dancer look more flexible and able to grasp the pole higher up to mount into tricks. But most importantly, Pleasers are very comfortable, the inside sole feels like memory foam, they where specifically made for dancers to wear during long shifts at the strip clubs (up to 8-10 hours). So next time you wonder how dancers manage in such high heels, well the answer is in the shoe engineering itself. 

  Now that you’re familiar with Pleasers we can move onto describing and embody the phenomenon of my alter ego. Throughout my thesis I use the analogy of ‘Pleaser as entry to my alter ego’. To illustrate, when i’m in my heels pole dancing class* and all us girls put on our Pleasers we all stand taller, we’re boosted up with a whole new attitude, flexibility, energy and sexiness about ourselves. We're still ourselves but elevated, physically and metaphorically. Theres a quote from a Minneapolis-based burlesque star, dancer, and professional dominatrix, who has about 20 pairs of Pleasers in rotation. Her description I was fond of, it went like this “The proportion just seems to power me up in a She-Ra sort of way. You know how you grab the sword and you’re like, ‘I have the power’? You put on a pair of Pleasers, and suddenly you’re in that space to access more of your own sexual power…’ This feeling, sense of own sexual power is everything i want to achieve through my alter ego. I honestly think everyone at some point in life should try on a pair of Pleasers… However with that being saidI don’t believe you have to be a dancer in Pleasers to experience this energy that comes with wearing Pleaser heels. Even as i described this to one of my classmates who’s not a dancer, he recalled a memory of the first time he stole and tried on his mothers heels, and could completely relate. </P>
 *Heels here refer to Pleasers, however here in The Hague this class is usually called ‘Exotic Pole Dance’. By definition the word ‘Exotic’ means ‘originating in or characteristic of a distant foreign country.’ During my time in Berlin and attending a studio called Pole Flow Berlin I learnt the history and harm of using the term ‘Exotic Pole Dance’. The history like most good stories, started with strippers, but more specifically the first BIPOC Sensual Dancers who arrived in colonized North America. BIPOC Sensual Dancers, such as Belly Dancers from North Africa became fetishes for the erotic nature of their performance and they're skin tone. The word ‘Erotic’ gained the meaning of ‘erotic’, ‘sensual and seductive’ minimizing BIPOC women to a sexual fantasy. 

 <H3 class="heading-font" > Acquired Aesthetics </H3>
 <P> To elaborate on the feeling of elevation and accessorizing i’d like to move on to talking about how my upbringing, acquired aesthetics, family history especially in jewelry, materialism and Lithuania's soviet history and all played a big role when it came to forming my alter ego. I’d like reiterate, these are elements i choose to keep and choose to include. As i will emphasize throughout, its not random its curated. 
Lets start from the beginning, I was born to two very young adults. As a result, I spent a-lot of time with my lovely grandmother Aldona in Druskininkai, a small town where we lived a very simple life. But my grandmothers far from simple, she the most glamorous lady you'll ever meet. There came a point where i started reflecting on how much of an influence my family upbringing and my grandmothers and in turn my mothers aesthetics had on me and my alter ego. I started realizing that not everyone's grandmother gardens in sparkly platform sandals. </P>

<P>I’d like to start with establishing the most important lesson I acquired whilst growing up. Looking rich. I was always been told to look rich, presentable and beautiful when I left the house. The more clothing that alludes to wealth the better, the more layered jewelry, gold, silver and diamonds the better. Luckily, I come from a line of jewelers, therefore there was always plenty to accessorize with. Jewelry in my family has always been important, & has always been important to me. I never buy jewelry, everything I wear is either made by my granddad or uncle, or passed down to me from previous generations of jewelers. I wear my jewelry with pride. I carry parts of my family with me daily. And I alternate compositions with the jewelry I wear every few months. I recently realized how special it is that each year of my life was marked with jewelry I was gifted, how every Christmas i received a custom made piece. It’s something I cherish deeply and adore.
This past Christmas of 2023 I was sitting in my grandmas kitchen, with many layered chains and necklaces on as usual. Some of them I had just received the day before from my granddad as a gift, some are very unique chains made by him. I layer them in a way thats a complimentary composition, my grandad and I contemplate it. Its of course not random, its curated. As my grandma sits beside me, she looks at me and is in thought, she proceeds to say something along the lines of ‘I’m just thinking about your necklaces, how your mother would layer them the same, how i would layer them and how my mother layered them like that too. We all do the same thing and love the same thing’... For me theres something so effortless and almost automatic in the way developed this admiration and love for jewelry, the way i learned to design its compositions on the body. I had always loved piling on as much as possible as a child and organizing and layering my grandmas jewelry (see image). As I reflect, and observe, I can see how these acquired aesthetics of looking rich and pilling on jewelry are very present within my alter ego today and consequently my design practice. There came a point where i wondered how could i add more? More in the sense of contrast, composition, fantasy and allure.  </P>

<P> For me this is where Sexy Plexi comes into the picture. As we have already acknowledged, I adore being over accessorized. When is comes to my alter ego I like to take it to the extreme. Thus a few years ago I started ‘Sexy Plexi’ my own little jewelry business. I started with the intention of creating more contrasting pieces to create compositions with. My grandads jewelry is beautiful but i wanted something that was different and in line with my alternating aesthetic, something i could change up and experiment with, layer, pile on and perhaps deconstruct. Sexy Plexi as a product is individual plexiglass pieces I design & cut using the laser cutter. These pieces of plexi come in different colors and can be arranged in different ways on the body. This way of producing was so effective for me to explore my kinda destiny of being a jewelry designer in my own contemporary way. I believe its a huge part of my alter ego, to pile jewelry on beyond the my usual extreme. To allow myself to further question how can i accessorize more? And most importantly do i look rich? I often contemplate these things whilst getting dressed. And although it may sound absurd, my graphic design studies and practice tough me to analyze all these intentional design choices. I approach getting dressed, accessorizing & getting my hair and make up done the same way i would when designing a book or a poster. As i’ll keep repeating, it is not random its curated. </P>

<H3 class="heading-font" > Materialism And Desire</H3>
<P> From my perspective, this obsession with looking rich, wearing exaggerated jewelry and having big desires for designer items is deeply rooted in materialism. However, not materialize in its simplest form*. With the help of bell hooks i’d like to delve into exactly what type of materialism i truly mean. One that comes from being suppressed as a society for many years, one that’s manifested in many different ways, ones thats not necessary humble but is more honest and pure, a type of materialism that is a part of reclaiming, re-accessorizing and healing from our soviet trauma. Before I continue I want to make a few things clear. The matter of the soviet union is recent in Lithuanian history, I find that many people tend for forget that. It was only 34 years ago that Lithuania declared independence on March 11th 1990. In total we where occupied for 50 years throughout witch we experienced immense suppression, hunger, brutality, enslavement, deportation, russification and the list goes on. I am the first generation within my family to have never experienced the oppression and cruelty of the Soviet Union. However, being born 11 years after its collapse i see first hand its leftovers on our society today.</P>
*a tendency to consider material possessions and physical comfort as more important than spiritual values.
<P> </P>So i’d like to delve into ‘Beauty Laid Bare, Aesthetics in the Ordinary’ by bell hooks, this text severed as an extremely influential piece as it showed me different ways and explanations of viewing my own surroundings, making sense of it all and how they influenced me and as mention before in tern my alter ego. I do however thinks its important to point out that this was also possible through the lens of intersectional feminism, as bell hooks writing focuses connections between race, gender and class and varied perceptions of Black women and feminist identities. Although our background and histories are very different, i found many similarities, in the way bell hooks describes the outcome and characteristics of a suppressed society, craving luxury but also creating style and beauty around them. Where to begin.
What firstly stood out to me was the idea of respectability linked to luxury possessions you own, but more specifically owning these expensive items whilst you cant afford to pay rent. The best way i can describe it is, in Lithuania you will see the most expensive cars on the streets and in parking lots of soviet apartment block buildings (my neighbor in Lithuania with his Bentley is a prime example). As bell hooks puts it ‘When it came to the issue of desiring and longing for the beautiful object, whether it was a house, a car, furniture, clothing, shoes, etc., everyone agreed, across class, that folks needed to be in touch with beauty. It was such a common way of thinking about life it seemed "natural."’ (page 120 Art on My Mind: Visual Politics. Essay Beauty Laid Bare Aesthetics in the Ordinary). I personally really relate to this quote and see how many people in Lithuania don’t need these cars and nor can they afford them, however i get the feeling in our society much like in the one bell hooks describes, this notion isn't questioned, its understood that getting this expensive car is respected and necessary.
Theres something there about the need and craving and desire to own these luxury items. I personally feel it too and have also observed it manifest in different ways among my family members. Ironically the more time i spend in Western Europe the more i get the impression that the general outlook of money and materialism is highly different, the perspective is very practical, and not enjoyable. If i’m honest, i find it almost sad. I grew up with the logic that money is there to be spent and enjoyed, not that there was always a huge surplus of it all the time, but if and when there was it was there to be enjoyed and not saved. After all ‘you cant take it with you when you die’ as my grandad would say. The other day i had some extra money and I brought some new 8 inch Pleaser heels, i didn't necessarily need them but i had been obsessively dreaming about them for months. These materialistic desires in turn allow us enjoy our lives of (fabricated) luxury. However, this idea of luxury also refers to the need to be surrounded by beauty, to collect beauty and to make beauty around ourselves. I see this need to collect within my family, this connection, admiration and eye for objects. Its definitely rooted in materialism however in a very humble and honest way. I can see how given our history and our past as a post soviet country we crave these objects that where once so scarce, we crave to have our own items and to keep them close, especially if beautiful. </P>
<H3 class="heading-font"> Materialism and Femisium </H3>
For the women in my family the idea of collecting beauty exists in the world of fashion and glamor. Again, always being a beautiful girl/women when exiting the house. My mother was always very glamorous no matter what occasion, outing or financial trouble she was in. Looking beautiful was always a priority. I enjoy the way Bell Hooks puts it ‘To my mother, "nice things" were not the earth, the sky, the eggs in the henhouse, "nice things" were the objects seen in advertisements, on the screen, and in catalogs.’ (PAGE 119). I saw first hand how as my mother progressed in life and became successful. The Chanel bags she now owns are a symbol of this success and dedication it took to get there. I find that the subject of materialism in feminism is frowned upon almost, its been heavily linked to negative consumption and capitalism. As bell hooks writes ‘Progressive feminist thinkers are more likely to critique the dangers of excessive materialism without discussing in a concrete way how we can balance a desire for beauty or luxury within an anticapitalist, anti sexist agenda.’ For example, to the women in my family i find fulfilling these materialistic desires comes from a place of pride, pride in taking care of themselves, pride in looking good and feeling good, pride in style, pride in family history, pride in the hard work it took to finally be able to purchase these luxury items, pride in being able to have autonomy and control over they’re on finances, pride in their own success. The women in my family have always been hard workers and have always stressed the importance of independence, why not celebrate it with fulfilling a long term desire? I believe that hyper-matelisium is not a sin, overall within feminism ‘we need to place aesthetics on our agenda’.
